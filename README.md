# azure-resume
My resume built on Azure following ACG tutorial

## First Steps 

- Updated static website to reflect my own resume.
- Created main.js containing visit counter function.
- Made a CosmosDB on Azure and setup the API using C# in the backend folder. 

> [!NOTE]
> This is where I first ran into some problems following the video since it's 2 years old. 

First thing was I know at the beginning of video Gwyn had mentioned the extension (Azure Functions and C#) need to be enabled, but I had done so after I typed some code.  This was causing some features to not work like
 ```func host start```.  There may have been a better way but saving my work, closing and reopening VS Code worked.

 The other issue was minor but following the video, when I needed to add the API function in workspace it was just in the lower pane below where she had in her video.
